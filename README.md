Part 1:
1. What code draws the blades of grass?
  A: line 11

2. What code makes the "lawnmover" come by? How often does it come by?
  A: line 18 and 19, the number in the random() determines how many times until it will cut and
  line 19 sets the cap height of the grass

3. What's the point of the "h" variable?
  A: The point of the "h" variable is to store the value 10.

4. What does the "-10" do in the second and fourth arguments of the "line" function, 
   "height-10-random(h)"? Why is it there?
 
 A:The second argument gives the grass where to start growing on the "y-axis"
    The fourth argument determines the direction of how the "grass" grows
    the "height-10-random(h)", It tells the height of the grass where to start
    
Part 2:
1. What's the point of an object?
  A: The point of an object makes coding a lot more oraganized and keep track of the coding

2. What's an example of a range you might use for the "map" function?
  A: map(mousex,0,800,0,400)

3. What line of code would you give me a random year in the last century?
  A: var x = random (1900,2029)
